# RexMcBride

The RexMcBride build of the Tales of Murder website is the prelim build out. Its primary goal is to dev a basic blog-type site that will allow posting of short stories as blog posts. It will include a basic home page that serves as a TOC/home base for the site. It will have a basic story page/template that will display a given short story. Additional elements will be added as time/ability allows.
